--- Adds a new dungeon section to the list of possible job destinations.
--- Section start values should always be added in ascending order.
--- @param zone string the string id of the dungeon zone.
--- @param segment number the numeric id of the dungeon segment.
--- @param start number the starting floor of this dungeon section (start counting from 1 for this).
--- @param difficulty string the string id of the difficulty assigned to this section.
--- @param finish number Only considered when first adding a segment to the list. This will be the last floor of the segment where jobs can spawn (start counting from 1 for this). If higher than the dungeon floors, it will default to the full dungeon length.
--- @param must_end boolean Only considered when first adding a segment to the list. If true, this segment must be completed before jobs can spawn in it. If false, the segment must be accessed at least once unless it's segment 0, which just needs to be unlocked. Defaults to true.
